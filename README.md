Create a runtime package.


For this exercise, you need to create a runtime package of either one of your application code, or the <code>vtune_project</code> folder present in this workspace.

However, this time, instead of using the interactive mode to create your application, can you use the CLI mode?

Don´t forget to source the OpenVINO environment and navigate to the proper directories in the terminal.

* Create a runtime package using the Deployment Manager in CLI mode
* If you like, try creating a runtime package of your own application (like something you built in the lesson on reducing model operations)

True or False: A single runtime package can be deployed to different devices like a VPU, FPGA and Int. GPU.

## TRUE
<strong>Correct!</strong> As long as you select all the hardwares you wish to deploy to when creating the runtime package, you can deploy it to those selected devices.
